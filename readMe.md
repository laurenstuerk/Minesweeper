# Minesweeper

Minesweeper --> Idea: The objective of the game is to direct a frog to its home by crossing a busy road and navigating a river by jumping on logs.

Details
- There is a large grid.

- There are some randomly planted “mines” hidden within this grid.

- The user must find the mines and indicate their location with flags.

- When the user clicks a square, the square will display a number, denoting how many mines are adjacent to this particular square.

- If the user clicks on any of the mines, they lose, and the game is over.


To start with, you’ll need some mechanism to generate the large grid. Then you’ll need to randomly place a specific number of mines. From here, the main mechanism you’ll need to employ will be the display of the numerical values. Again, you’ll need to track the winning state as well as the losing one. Furhtermore include sounds and make sure you can decide between the same options as the orginal minesweeper. Different grid sizes to start with. At least provide 2 options.
